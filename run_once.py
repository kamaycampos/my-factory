"""One scheduling pass. Publishes whatever is due, then exits.

WHY THIS EXISTS. 13 Sept 2026. The machine ran on Railway, which bills for a
service that is awake 24 hours a day so it can be useful for the few seconds a
day something is actually due. Kamay's bill reached $13.79 against a $15 cap
with an estimate of $28.16, and he was clear: "im already paying you 20$ a
month, that already its my limit."

GitHub Actions is free without limit on a public repository - verified, not
assumed - so the same work costs nothing if it runs as a cron job instead of a
daemon. That is the whole change: `while True` becomes one pass, and the state
that lived on a Railway volume is committed back to the repository.

The media moves too. Instagram's API will not take bytes; it fetches from a
URL, which is why a server was needed at all. GitHub Releases serve public
files for free, so a release asset replaces the Railway media route.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED: every posting rule, the spacing, the source
mixing, the keyword freezing, the fence between the two accounts. All of that
is hard-won and lives in engine/. This file only decides when it runs and where
the files are.

# NINE-TO-FIVE-BILLIONAIRE published at 17:28 and again at 20:28. The first run
# posted it perfectly and then FAILED TO SAVE that fact - its `git push` was
# rejected because another commit had landed while it was uploading, and
# nothing retried. The clip came back looking unposted, so the next run posted
# it again on every account.
#
# Git cannot be the only record of something that already happened in the
# world. This log is appended in the release the moment a clip is published -
# one API call, no merge, no rebase - and read at the start of every run, so a
# lost commit can no longer cause a second post.
