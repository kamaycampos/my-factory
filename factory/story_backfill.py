"""Give every clip already in the queue its story cut - in the cloud, Mac shut.

28 Sept 2026, Kamay: "i want you to make our IG to post EVERY SINGLE CLIP WE POST
to also posted in the story". The renderer now cuts a `__story.mp4` for every new
clip, but the ones already queued were rendered before that existed, and a story
is refused for anything over 60 seconds. This walks the queue, fetches each clip
that has no story cut yet, makes one, and uploads it beside the clip.

    python factory/story_backfill.py [--limit N] [--dry]

Nothing here touches the manifest: a story cut is an extra file, not a decision.
