"""Is the whole machine actually working? One screen, no guessing.

23 Sept 2026. Three bugs in one night shared a shape: the work happened and the
record of it was lost, and each was found only because someone went looking.
This looks in every place at once - the queue, the posting cadence, the last run
of every workflow, the month's episode list, the planner's output and the
measurements - and prints what is wrong in plain words.
